<p align="justify">The Right to Information act is a law enacted by the 
Parliament of India access to records of the Central Government and State 
Governments. The Act applies to all States and Union Territories of India, 
except the State of Jammu and Kashmir - which is covered under a State-level 
law. Under the provisions of the Act, any citizen (including the citizens within 
J&amp;K) may request information from a &quot;public authority&quot; (a body of Government or 
&quot;instrumentality of State&quot;) which is required to reply expeditiously or within 
thirty days. The Act also requires every public authority to computerise their 
records for wide dissemination and to proactively publish certain categories of 
information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request for 
information formally.This law was passed by Parliament on
<span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</span> and came 
fully into force on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2005-10-13">13 
October 2005</span>. Information disclosure in India was hitherto restricted by 
the Official Secrets Act 1923 and various other special laws, which the new RTI 
Act now relaxes.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt"> Under the Act, all authorities covered must appoint their <b>Public 
Information Officer</b> (PIO). Any person may submit a request to the PIO for 
information in writing. It is the PIO's obligation to provide information to 
citizens of India who request information under the Act. If the request pertains 
to another public authority (in whole or part) it is the PIO's responsibility to 
transfer/forward the concerned portions of the request to a PIO of the other 
within 5 days. In addition, every public authority is required to designate <b>
Assistant Public Information Officers</b> (APIOs) to receive RTI requests and 
appeals for forwarding to the PIOs of their public authority. The citizen making 
the request is not obliged to disclose any information except his name and 
contact particulars.</p>
<p>The Act specifies time limits for replying to the request.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the request has been made to the PIO, the reply is to be given within
  <b>30 days</b> of receipt. </li>
  <li>If the request has been made to an APIO, the reply is to be given within
  <b>35 days</b> of receipt. </li>
  <li>If the PIO transfers the request to another public authority (better 
  concerned with the information requested), the time allowed to reply is <b>30 
  days</b> but computed from the day after it is received by the PIO of the 
  transferee authority. </li>
  <li>Information concerning corruption and Human Rights violations by scheduled 
  Security agencies (those listed in the Second Schedule to the Act) is to be 
  provided within <b>45 days</b> but with the prior approval of the Central 
  Information Commission. </li>
  <li>However, if life or liberty of any person is involved, the PIO is expected 
  to reply within <b>48 hours</b>. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt">Since the information is to be paid for, the reply of the PIO is necessarily 
limited to either denying the request (in whole or part) and/or providing a 
computation of &quot;further fees&quot;. The time between the reply of the PIO and the 
time taken to deposit the further fees for information is excluded from the time 
allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt">If 
the information is not provided within this period, it is treated as deemed 
refusal. Refusal with or without reasons may be ground for appeal or complaint. 
Further, information not provided in the times prescribed is to be provided free 
of charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt">For Central Departments as of 2006, there is a fee of Rs. 10 for filing the 
request, Rs. 2 per page of information and Rs. 5 for each hour of inspection 
after the first hour. If the applicant is a Below Poverty Card holder, then no 
fee shall apply. Such BPL Card holders have to provide a copy of their BPL card 
along with their application to the Public Authority. States Government and High 
Courts fix their own rules.</p>
